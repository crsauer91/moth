THE MOTH WHO WROTE COMMITS INTO THE VOID: A 5000-WORD SPRINT THROUGH ABSURDITY, DESPAIR, AND FOOT-RELATED EXISTENTIALISM

Once upon a time, in a decaying Khrushchyovka somewhere between Irkutsk and your mom’s moral compass, lived a moth named Grigoriy Leatherflapov. Grigoriy was no ordinary moth—he had dreams, you see. Dreams not of lightbulbs, but of light mode. He longed not for a flame, but for a repository. And most of all, he longed to understand why the f*** every time he tried to push to main, the commit message said “feet hurt.”
One night, overwhelmed by the futility of merging changes nobody asked for, Grigoriy flew into the warm, sterile glow of a podiatrist’s neon sign. His wings, coded in HTML and broken promises, fluttered like a dev’s hope on demo day.
Inside sat Dr. Yevgeny Toechevski, a man so emotionally numb he made a turnip look like Oprah. The man had fingers like kielbasa and breath that could knock a falcon out of flight. He didn’t blink. Not once. That was his thing.
“Why are you here?” grunted Yevgeny without looking up from a badly annotated foot x-ray shaped suspiciously like a bootleg Super Mario.
And Grigoriy, God help us, began to speak.

“Doctor,” the moth began, “I’ve been committing to life for years, but I’m stuck in a loop. Every pull request leads me back to the same issue: chronic toe-based despair. You ever tried refactoring regret, doc? It’s like bunions on your soul.”
Yevgeny didn’t flinch. Somewhere in the back room, a nurse cried into a jar of orthopedic inserts.
“I once loved a butterfly named Vladimira,” the moth continued, antennae drooping like a depressed semaphore. “She left me for a cockroach who could do git rebase without crying.”
Meanwhile, the podiatrist reached for a bottle of rubbing alcohol with the same energy your dad uses to pretend your birth certificate doesn’t exist.
“I forked my own heart, doc,” sobbed the moth. “And now I’m in a foot clinic asking a man who smells like expired mayonnaise if my emotional corns are terminal.”
Yevgeny nodded, finally speaking. “You need arch support. And probably God.”
And then he performed surgery on himself.

Meanwhile, in a completely unrelated incident:
	1.	A man in Minsk tried to marry a toaster because it was the only thing that had ever listened to him without judgement.
	2.	A parrot in Vladivostok learned how to quote Nietzsche but only used it to win arguments with cats.
	3.	Your father, statistically, is hiding in a bowling alley and refusing to return your texts because you remind him too much of your Aunt Luba’s third chin.

Anyway, Grigoriy the moth eventually rage-quit GitHub, became a shoe insert, and died inside a Croc™ during a ska concert.
