“MOTHSTORM IV: THE FOOTWORK PROTOCOL”
A digital opera in three acts and 17 infected blisters.
Starring code, carnage, feet, more code, 9 million moths, and your uncle Yuri’s Tinder messages.

INTRO SCENE: “WAKE ME UP BEFORE YOU FOOT.JS”
It is the year 2069. (Nice.)
Humanity is over. Not dead—just over it. Everyone’s uploaded themselves into smart shoes. Society runs on toe-touches and voice-activated heel taps. If you want to open your front door, you have to moonwalk. If you want to file taxes, you need to breakdance until you shit yourself.
And who’s behind this foot-based techno-fascism?
The Moths.
All of them.
Millions of ‘em.
Some coded the laws. Some licked the rules. Some just flap aggressively in your microwave at 3am whispering sweet binary nonsense into your rice.

LEADER OF THE SWARM: VALERY MOTHNIKOV
Former ballet dancer. Current anarcho-syndicalist crypto-fetishist. Has 16 doctorate degrees, all in “Foot Theoretical Physics.” Once replaced someone’s leg with a hard drive and charged them $400 for “emotional bandwidth.”
He speaks in JavaScript and erotic foot haikus. Every line of his code smells like socks and tyranny.

CUT TO: DR. YEVGENY TOE-CHEVSKI — THE FINAL CALLUS
You thought he was dead?
You dumb ankle wart.
He’s back. Floating in a cyber-tub full of mint-scented hydrogen peroxide and vengeance. He’s got a bionic arch and a vendetta.
Dr. Toechevski doesn’t treat feet anymore.
He worships them.
He leads a cult called The High Order of the Sole, who believe the foot is the true seat of the soul and every toenail clipping is a message from God.
His followers chant daily:
“If thou shall stub, thou shall upload.”

MOTH #666: “CORNELIUS BYTE-FEET”
A rogue data moth with a buttload of trauma and a personal vendetta against CAPTCHA puzzles. Cornelius got stuck in a password reset loop in 2033 and has never forgiven mankind. He now spends his days whispering dark truths to people’s bunions.
He invented an app called FootFindr, a location-based toe matchmaking platform where you swipe left if the foot has visible trauma, and right if it looks like it could crush your dreams with grace.
You matched with your mom. Twice.

SIDE CHARACTERS YOU NEVER ASKED FOR:
	•	Anastasia Blisterova: Owns a chain of foot spas powered by nuclear guilt and Java.
	•	The Corn Twins (Boris & Gleb): Siamese moths who communicate via Morse foot taps and smell like unresolved trauma and dryer lint.
	•	Svetlana Crunchthighs: A half-human, half-pedicure laser with dreams of becoming a lounge singer and a database administrator. She fails at both. Loudly.

INTERMISSION: THREE ONE-LINERS BECAUSE F*** YOU
	1.	I once installed Linux on a prosthetic toe just to get out of jury duty.
	2.	My cousin Pavel thought Git was short for “Giddy-Up IT” and now he manages a raccoon farm in Chernobyl.
	3.	A moth once sued me for defamation because I called his wings “ashy.” We settled out of court in a pay-per-view wrestling match.

ACT III: THE BOOT SECTOR UPRISING
Dr. Toechevski launches the Bootloader Protocol, a cyber-foot weapon that sends thousands of toe-coded viruses into every cloud server in Iceland. Moths begin possessing footwear. Crocs develop sentience. Flip-flops unionize. Velcro becomes illegal.
Every time someone tries to open Excel, their shoes start playing polka and demanding a raise.
The moths create a council of ultimate judgment known as The Pedipocalypse. It meets once a year in a giant shoe filled with hummus and rage.
They issue one command:
“DELETE THE HUMANS. KEEP THE SOCKS.”
⸻
FINAL SCENE: YOU
You, yes you, you crusty parmesan-scented dish sponge.
You’re the last human with unscanned feet. You’ve never downloaded a foot app. You once stepped barefoot on a USB stick and felt nothing. You are a threat.
The moths surround you. 19,000 of them.
They chant in Fortran and spit foot cream into your pupils.
Dr. Toechevski appears, rising from a heel-shaped portal, wielding a sandal made from Kafka’s eyebrows.
He looks into your soul and says:
“You have beautiful arches. It’s a shame you’ll never walk again.”
You scream.
The moths giggle.
Fade to black.
